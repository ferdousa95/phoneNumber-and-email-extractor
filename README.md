Lets say you are looking at a webpage and you want to find all the numbers and 
email addresses you can find in here. However, the webpage is quite long and as 
a lazy/busy person, you want to just CTRL+A all the text, and CTRL+C copy and run 
the program which will automatically find all the numbers and email addresses it 
can find inside that webpage

The basic works of our extractor is:
1. Get the text off the clipboard.
2. Find all phone nubmers and email addresses in the text.
3. Paste them onto the clipboard.
